1. Where (which directory path) is your SOF file located, and what it is called
- .\Lab5_template_de1soc
- dds_and_nios_lab.qpf

2. What is the status of the lab (what works, what doesn't)
- Status: 
	What works: Everything required in the basic solution - LFSR, DDS, CDC, VGA waveform generation, Nios 2 interrupt FSK modulation, etc.
		       2 bonuses - QPSK modulation (10%) and Adding Color Changes to graph (5%).
		       The second bonus has a partial implementation, we were able to add the next/prev buttons, however we couldn't add additional songs.

	What doesn't work: We don't have additional songs (5% bonus).
	

- Fully Compiled w/ Histogram and Audio Support.

3. Annotated simulation screenshots as required by the lab
- Can be found in simulations.docx

4. Information on how to run the simulations (i.e. where the files are located, which program you used to run your simulation)
- Testbenches included, can be run via modelsim if required (by simulating them, all parameters set). However simulation screenshots are provided for the exact same testbenches.

5. Any additional information that would be relevant for the TA marking your project.
- In our simulation screenshits, we provided screenshots for our new CDC and old CDC logic as well. We would like the new CDC logic screenshots to be considered while grading, I decided to keep the old CDC logic screenshots as they convey an important concept.
